The Cauchy property of a sequence of real numbers states that in order to know the limit of the sequence up to an approximation $2^{-k}$ we have to compute the n-th element of the sequence. This n is the most important information we have about the value of the limit of the sequence, unfortunately it is often non-computable in the parameters of the sequence. The paper is about the next best information we may have, an effective bound to the number of mistakes we may do while making assumptions on the value of n. This goal is interesting and the paper contains some relevant results in this direction ...
