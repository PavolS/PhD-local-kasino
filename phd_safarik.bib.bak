	Notre Dame J. Formal Logic 50, No. 4, 393--425 (2009; Zbl 1223.03052)].
	The abstract that the authors give is very adequate: ``In this paper
	we study a reducibility that has been introduced by Klaus Weihrauch
	or, more precisely, a natural extension for multi-valued functions
	on represented spaces. We call the corresponding equivalence classes
	Weihrauch degrees and we show that the corresponding partial order
	induces a lower semilattice. It turns out that parallelization is
	a closure operator for this semilattice and that the parallelized
	Weihrauch degrees even form a lattice into which the Medvedev lattice
	and the Turing degrees can be embedded. The importance of Weihrauch
	degrees is based on the fact that multi-valued functions on represented
	spaces can be considered as realizers of mathematical theorems in
	a very natural way and studying the Weihrauch reductions between
	theorems in this sense means to ask which theorems can be transformed
	continuously or computably into each other. As crucial corner points
	of this classification scheme the limited principle of omniscience,
	LPO, the lesser limited principle of omniscience, LLPO, and their
	parallelizations are studied. It is proved that parallelized LLPO
	is equivalent to Weak K\"onig's Lemma and hence to the Hahn-Banach
	Theorem in this new and very strong sense. We call a multi-valued
	function weakly computable if it is reducible to the Weihrauch degree
	of parallelized LLPO and we present a new proof, based on a computational
	version of Kleene's ternary logic, that the class of weakly computable
	operations is closed under composition. Moreover, weakly computable
	operations on computable metric spaces are characterized as operations
	that admit upper semi-computable compact-valued selectors and it
	is proved that any single-valued weakly computable operation is already
	computable in the ordinary sense.''}},
