This paper represents a significant contribution to the program of ``proof
mining'' in nonlinear analysis, which aims to extract effective information
hidden in the proofs.\\
Applying methods coming from mathematical logic to results obtained by
Wittmann~\cite{Wittmann90}, the author extracts effective rates of metastability (in the sense
of Terence Tao) for nonlinear generalizations of the classical von Neumann
mean ergodic theorem.\\
... the author
gets a finitary version of the mean ergodic theorem for nonlinear mappings
$T : X \to X$ satisfying $\|T x + T y\| \leq \|x + y\|$ for all $x, y \in X$.
